=> the "project-out" algorithm is still slow :
  * investigate on slow matrix functions ?
  * run a profiler ??

=> differenciate fitting algorithms (setup a class hierarchy)
  * allow to switch from an algorithm to another

=> add a very simple octave code to build the training set ??

=> begin training set building
  * compute jacobians
  * video and image collections as training sets
    * load existing annoted sets
      * and compute space => PCA and so on
    * handle training set annotations (mouse based)
=> debugging
  * matrix-image display (with image stat : min, max, etc.)

=> Then write tracking functions
   => handle videos and image collections as input

=> add scripting support
   * cf swig
=> add windows port
